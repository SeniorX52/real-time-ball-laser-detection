## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time ball and laser pointer detection system using two different computer vision approaches:

1. **Traditional Computer Vision**: HSV color space filtering with OpenCV
2. **Deep Learning**: YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection with custom training

The system can track objects in real-time, providing position coordinates and visual feedback through multiple display windows.

## Computer Vision Fundamentals

### What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. It mimics human vision by processing images and videos to extract meaningful information.

### Key Concepts

#### **Pixel**
- The smallest unit of a digital image
- Contains color information (typically RGB values)
- Images are made up of millions of pixels arranged in a grid

#### **Color Spaces**
Different ways to represent colors in digital images:

- **RGB (Red, Green, Blue)**: Additive color model, each pixel has red, green, and blue intensity values (0-255)
- **HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)**: More intuitive for color-based filtering
- **BGR**: OpenCV's default format (Blue, Green, Red)

#### **Image Processing Pipeline**
1. **Capture**: Get image from camera or file
2. **Preprocessing**: Enhance, resize, or convert the image
3. **Processing**: Apply algorithms to detect objects
4. **Post-processing**: Filter results, draw visualizations
5. **Output**: Display results or save data

## Object Detection Methods

### Method 1: Traditional Computer Vision (HSV Filtering)

#### How It Works
1. **Color Space Conversion**: Convert RGB image to HSV
2. **Color Filtering**: Create a mask for specific color ranges
3. **Morphological Operations**: Clean up the mask (remove noise)
4. **Contour Detection**: Find object boundaries
5. **Object Extraction**: Get position and size information

#### Advantages
- Fast processing (real-time performance)
- Simple to understand and implement
- Works well for objects with distinct colors
- Low computational requirements

#### Disadvantages
- Sensitive to lighting changes
- Only works with specific colors
- Can be fooled by objects of similar colors
- Requires manual parameter tuning

### Method 2: Deep Learning (YOLO)

#### How It Works
1. **Neural Network**: Uses a trained deep learning model
2. **Feature Extraction**: Automatically learns object features
3. **Classification**: Identifies what objects are present
4. **Localization**: Determines where objects are located
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Provides detection confidence

#### Advantages
- Robust to lighting and environmental changes
- Can detect multiple object types simultaneously
- Learns complex features automatically
- High accuracy for trained objects

#### Disadvantages
- Requires more computational power
- Needs training data for custom objects
- More complex to understand and modify
- Longer inference time (especially on CPU)

## YOLO Deep Dive

### What is YOLO?

**YOLO (You Only Look Once)** is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that can detect multiple objects in an image in a single forward pass through a neural network.

### How YOLO Works

#### **1. Grid Division**
- Divides the input image into an SxS grid (e.g., 13x13)
- Each grid cell is responsible for detecting objects whose center falls within it

#### **2. Bounding Box Prediction**
- Each grid cell predicts multiple bounding boxes
- A bounding box consists of:
  - **x, y**: Center coordinates (relative to grid cell)
  - **width, height**: Box dimensions (relative to image)
  - **confidence**: Probability that the box contains an object

#### **3. Class Prediction**
- Each grid cell also predicts class probabilities
- For our project: Ball (class 0) and Laser (class 1)

#### **4. Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**
- Removes duplicate detections
- Keeps only the best detection for each object
- Uses IoU (Intersection over Union) to determine overlaps

### YOLO Architecture (YOLOv8-Nano)

```
Input Image (640x640x3)
        ↓
Backbone Network (Feature Extraction)
        ↓
Neck (Feature Pyramid Network)
        ↓
Head (Detection Layers)
        ↓
Output: [batch_size, num_predictions, 6]
        (x, y, width, height, confidence, class)
```

#### **Backbone**
- Extracts features from the input image
- Uses convolutional layers to detect edges, shapes, and patterns
- Progressively reduces image size while increasing feature depth

#### **Neck**
- Combines features from different scales
- Enables detection of both small and large objects
- Uses Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) architecture

#### **Head**
- Makes final predictions for each grid cell
- Outputs bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class probabilities

### YOLO vs Other Detection Methods

| Method | Speed | Accuracy | Real-time |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| R-CNN | Slow | High | No |
| Fast R-CNN | Medium | High | Limited |
| YOLO | Fast | Good-High | Yes |
| SSD | Fast | Good | Yes |

## HSV Color Space

### What is HSV?

HSV stands for **Hue, Saturation, Value** - a color space that's more intuitive for color-based filtering than RGB.

### HSV Components

#### **Hue (H)**
- Represents the color itself (0-179 in OpenCV)
- 0° = Red, 60° = Yellow, 120° = Green, 180° = Cyan, 240° = Blue, 300° = Magenta
- Circular scale (0 and 179 are both red)

#### **Saturation (S)**
- Represents color intensity/purity (0-255)
- 0 = Grayscale (no color)
- 255 = Pure, vivid color

#### **Value (V)**
- Represents brightness (0-255)
- 0 = Black
- 255 = Brightest

### Why HSV for Object Detection?

1. **Lighting Independence**: Hue remains relatively constant under different lighting
2. **Intuitive Filtering**: Easy to select color ranges
3. **Better Segmentation**: Separates color information from brightness

### HSV Filtering Process

```python
# Convert to HSV
hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)

# Define color range (example for yellow ball)
lower_yellow = np.array([20, 100, 100])  # Lower HSV bounds
upper_yellow = np.array([30, 255, 255])  # Upper HSV bounds

# Create mask
mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_yellow, upper_yellow)

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```

### Key Components

#### **1. Video Stream Handler (VideoStream Class)**
```python
class VideoStream:
    def __init__(self, src=0):
        self.stream = cv2.VideoCapture(src)
        self.grabbed, self.frame = self.stream.read()
        self.stopped = False
        
    def start(self):
        # Start threaded video capture
        Thread(target=self.update, args=()).start()
        
    def update(self):
        # Continuously read frames in background
        while not self.stopped:
            self.grabbed, self.frame = self.stream.read()
```

**Purpose**: Handles video capture in a separate thread to prevent blocking the main processing loop.

#### **2. HSV Parameter Control**
Trackbars allow real-time adjustment of HSV filtering parameters:

```python
cv2.createTrackbar("Hue Min", "hsv settings", 0, 179, lambda x: None)
cv2.createTrackbar("Sat Min", "hsv settings", 0, 255, lambda x: None)
cv2.createTrackbar("Val Min", "hsv settings", 0, 255, lambda x: None)
```

#### **3. YOLO Detector Class**
```python
class YOLOBallDetector:
    def __init__(self, model_path='yolov8n.pt'):
        self.model = YOLO(model_path)  # Load pretrained model
        self.conf = 0.3  # Confidence threshold
        
    def detect_yellow_ball(self, frame, hsv_low, hsv_high):
        # Run YOLO inference
        results = self.model(frame, conf=self.conf)
        # Post-process with HSV filtering
        return self.filter_by_color(results, hsv_low, hsv_high)
```

#### **4. Coordinate System**
Converts pixel coordinates to real-world measurements:

```python
# Convert to millimeter coordinates
side = min(frame.shape[0], frame.shape[1])
x_mm = (cx / side) * grid_mm - (grid_mm / 2)
y_mm = (grid_mm / 2) - (cy / side) * grid_mm
```

## Training Custom Models

### Why Train Custom Models?

1. **Domain Specificity**: Generic models may not detect your specific objects well
2. **Improved Accuracy**: Models trained on your data perform better in your environment
3. **Reduced False Positives**: Less likely to confuse similar objects
4. **Custom Classes**: Can detect objects not in standard datasets

### Training Pipeline

#### **1. Data Collection**
```python
# Capture training images
def collect_training_data():
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord(' '):
            cv2.imwrite(f"frame_{timestamp}.jpg", frame)
```

#### **2. Data Annotation**
Using labelme or custom annotation tools to create bounding boxes:

```json
{
  "shapes": [
    {
      "label": "ball",
      "points": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2]],
      "shape_type": "rectangle"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **3. Format Conversion**
Convert annotations to YOLO format:

```
# YOLO format: class_id center_x center_y width height (normalized)
0 0.5 0.3 0.2 0.15
```

#### **4. Model Training**
```python
# Train YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Load pretrained weights
results = model.train(
    data='dataset.yaml',
    epochs=100,
    imgsz=640,
    patience=50
)
```

#### **5. Model Validation**
- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**: Measures detection accuracy
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
