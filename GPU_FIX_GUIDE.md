# 🚀 GPU Setup Fix Guide

## ✅ What We Found:
- Your NVIDIA GTX 1650 is working perfectly
- Driver 580.97 with CUDA 13.0 support
- PyTorch 2.8.0 was installed (likely CPU-only version)

## 🔧 What We're Doing:
Installing CUDA-enabled PyTorch compatible with your GPU:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

## 🧪 After Installation Test:
Run these tests to verify GPU is working:

```python
# Test 1: Check PyTorch CUDA
python quick_gpu_test.py

# Test 2: Full GPU performance test  
python test_gpu.py

# Test 3: Run your ball tracker with GPU
python ball_tracker2.py
```

## 🎯 Expected Results:
- CUDA available: True
- YOLO running on: cuda
- Significant performance improvement (2-3x faster)
- Lower CPU usage during detection

## 💡 Why This Happened:
- PyTorch has separate versions for CPU-only and CUDA
- Default `pip install torch` installs CPU-only version
- Need specific CUDA index URL for GPU support
- Your CUDA 13.0 is newer than most PyTorch builds, but CUDA 12.1 PyTorch should work

## 🔍 Performance Comparison:
- **Before (CPU)**: ~5-10 FPS YOLO detection
- **After (GPU)**: ~20-30 FPS YOLO detection
- **Memory**: GPU will use VRAM instead of system RAM
